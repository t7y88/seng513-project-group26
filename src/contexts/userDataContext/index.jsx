// UserDataContext.jsx
//
// This file defines a React context for storing and accessing authenticated
// user data and their completed hikes. It centralizes data loading logic and
// provides a shared state across the app so that multiple components can access
// the current user's profile and hike history without making duplicate API calls.

// It is used to initialize the context and acts as a fallback if the context is
// accessed outside of the provider (not recommended).

// Create the context object that will store and provide user data.
// This will be consumed using useContext in child components.

 * - completedHikes: an array of hike records completed by the user
